  <h2>Why get a dog?</h2>
  <p>
    Spending just 15-30 minutes with your dog can help you feel more calm and relaxed, reducing stress and increasing happiness. Playing with your pup increases your brain’s levels of dopamine and serotonin, both of which are neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and tranquility. So the next time you’re feeling down, grab a toy and spend some time with your pup! That wagging tail will be sure to put a smile on your face.
