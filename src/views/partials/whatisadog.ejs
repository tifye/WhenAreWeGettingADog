  <h2>What is a dog?</h2>
  <p>
    The dog is a domesticated descendant of 
    the wolf. The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, 
    and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated, 
    by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.
